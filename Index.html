            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
               My name is Santiago Arango, and I am currently a fourth-year student at Northeastern University, pursuing a combined major in Business Administration and Data Science. I’m originally from Colombia, but now I live in Long Island with my family, which includes my mom, dad, brother, and our two cats.
In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends, exploring Boston, and playing a variety of sports. I play on an intramural soccer team and broomball team, both of which I love. In broomball, I play goalie, a position I find manageable and fun. The main reason for playing as a goalkeeper is because I got a concussion while playing outfield. This incident has made me more cautious about potential injuries.
On my soccer team, I alternate between defense and midfield. Although the competition is fierce, I like being challenged. Beyond sports, I am also engaged with four different campus ministries. My involvement began during my first and second years, due to my curiosity about various events and belief systems. I am primarily connected to the Catholic Center, where I’ve built close friendships and feel at home, especially since I grew up in a Catholic household. Overall, my academic pursuits, athletic endeavors, and spiritual involvement are the highlights of my university experience.
